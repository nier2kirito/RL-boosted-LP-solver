- **Convergence Trend**: 0.000456
- **Recent vs Early Improvement**: 1.849
- **Is Converging**: ❌ NO
- **Is Improving**: ✅ YES

## Diagnosis

### ✅ Training appears healthy:

- **Flat Learning Curve**: No significant trend in rewards
  → May need curriculum learning, better initialization, or reward shaping


## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Reduce Solver Failures**: Increase time limits or use more robust problems
2. **Improve Reward Signal**: Use iteration-based metrics for small problems
3. **Better Baseline**: Implement neural baseline or larger reward buffer
4. **Add Regularization**: Include entropy bonus for better exploration

### Advanced Improvements:
1. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easier problems, gradually increase difficulty
2. **Multi-Objective Rewards**: Combine time, iterations, and feasibility metrics
3. **Better Clustering**: Try learned clustering instead of k-means
4. **Hierarchical Learning**: Learn cluster ordering and within-cluster ordering separately

### Configuration Changes:
```yaml
training:
  learning_rate: 3e-4        # Increase learning rate
  entropy_weight: 0.02       # Add exploration bonus
  baseline_buffer_size: 200  # Better baseline estimates
  solver_time_limit: 180.0   # Reduce timeouts
  temperature_schedule:
    initial_temp: 2.0        # More initial exploration
    min_temp: 0.05          # Lower final temperature
```
